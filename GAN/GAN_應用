INCREASING VARIATION USING MINIBATCH STANDARD DEVIATION

minibatch discrimination

variation problem

first compute
the standard deviation for each feature in each spatial location over the minibatch. 
We then average these estimates over all features and spatial locations to arrive at a single value. 
We replicate the
value and concatenate it to all spatial locations and over the minibatch, yielding one additional (constant)
feature map.
