Packages
-----

Data analysis

* NumPy -- the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* Pandas -- data structures and data analysis tools; enables you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain-specific language like R; Series and DataFrame are based on Python dictionaries and NumPy arrays
* MatPlotLib -- MATLAB clone for Python
* [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) -- interactive data visualizations for the web
* [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io) -- interactive data visualizations for the web
* [seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) -- visualization for MatPlotLib

Application-specific

* Scikit-Bio -- underlying codebase for QIIME, replacement for PyCogent
* Biopython -- has some useful code, but the Knight Lab hates it
* QIIME -- microbiome and statistical analysis package
* Others: math, collections, operator, future, csv
* Sympy -- symbolic mathematics
* Statsmodels -- to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests
* Scikit-learn -- tools for data mining and data analysis (including machine learning)
* PyQt -- Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform graphical user interface toolkit (or the equivalent Pyside)
* Spyder -- interactive development environment with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features
